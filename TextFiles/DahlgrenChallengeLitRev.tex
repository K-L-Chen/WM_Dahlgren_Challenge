\section*{The Weapon-Target Assignment Problem \\ \cite{wtap_kline_2019}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item As $\uparrow$ quantity and quality of missiles, effective allocation research emerged.
    \item Weapon Target Assignment (WTA) aka Missile Allocation Problem (MAP) $\Leftrightarrow$ minimize probabiilty of a missile destroying a protected assignment
    \item Sometimes offense perspective OR defense perspective 
    \item WTA $\rightarrow$ Static WTA (SWTA) or Dynamic WTA (DWTA)
    \item SWTA:
    \\ input: num. of incoming missiles (targets), num. of interceptors (weapons), probabilities of destroying targets
    \\ output: how many of each weapon type to shoot at each target

    \item DWTA includes time as a dimension. Two variants: two-stage and shoot-look-shoot

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Two-stage DWTA: 
        \\ stages/input: 1. SWTA and 2. probability distribution of various kinds of targets 
        \\ output: 1. allocation of weapons and 2. how many weapons to reserve to minimize prob. of destruction
        
        \item Shoot-kill-Shoot DWTA:
        \\ replicates SWTA too, but enables observation of leakers: target that maybe survived the initial engagement for a subsequent engagement
        \\ solution: allocation of weapons and reservation of weapons to rengage any leakers
    \end{itemize}

    \item WTA is NP-Complete, so majority of solutions seek near-optimal solutions in real-time, or fast-enough solutions before the adversary reaches their goals.
    \item These solutions use heuristics or have exact solutions applied to variants of the WTA problem

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Formulations}

Notation:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_{i j}$ : the probability weaponi destroys target $j$
\item $q_{i j} (= 1 - p_{i j})$ : the probability weapon $i$ fails to destroys target $j$
\item $V_j$ : the destructive value of target $j$
\item $x_{i j}$ : the number of weapons of type $i$ assigned to target $j$
\item $K$ : the number of protected assets
\item $a_k$ : the value of asset $k$
\item $n$ : the number of targets
\item $m$ : the number of weapon types
\item $w_i$ : the number of weapons of type $i$
\item $c_{i j}$ : a cost parameter for assigning a weapon of type $i$ to target $j$
\item $\mathcal{F}$ : the set of feasible assignments
\item $\gamma_{j k}$ : the probability target $j$ destroys asset $k$
\item $s_j$ : the maximum number of weapons that can be assigned to target $j$
\item $t$ : the number of stages


Main formulation:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\min & \sum_{j=1}^n V_j \prod_{i=1}^m q_{i j}^{x_{i j}} \\
\text { s.t. } & \sum_{j=1}^n x_{i j} \leq w_i \text {, for } i=1, \ldots, m \\
& x_{i j} \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}, \text {for } i=1, \ldots, m, j=1, \ldots, n
\end{array}
$$

In English: find the best assignment of number of weapons, across all types, that minimizes 
the survival rate of the targets, with higher emphasis of those with more destructive value.
The ``such that (s.t.)'' requriements indicate that we must respect our supply capacity of weapons and 
that we must allocate at least weapon of each type to all targets.
