\section*{The Weapon-Target Assignment Problem \\ \cite{wtap_kline_2019}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item As $\uparrow$ quantity and quality of missiles, effective allocation research emerged.
    \item Weapon Target Assignment (WTA) aka Missile Allocation Problem (MAP) $\Leftrightarrow$ minimize probabiilty of a missile destroying a protected assignment
    \item Sometimes offense perspective OR defense perspective 
    \item WTA $\rightarrow$ Static WTA (SWTA) or Dynamic WTA (DWTA)
    \item SWTA:
    \\ input: num. of incoming missiles (targets), num. of interceptors (weapons), probabilities of destroying targets
    \\ output: how many of each weapon type to shoot at each target

    \item DWTA includes time as a dimension. Two variants: two-stage and shoot-look-shoot

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Two-stage DWTA: 
        \\ stages/input: 1. SWTA and 2. probability distribution of various kinds of targets 
        \\ output: 1. allocation of weapons and 2. how many weapons to reserve to minimize prob. of destruction
        
        \item Shoot-kill-Shoot DWTA:
        \\ replicates SWTA too, but enables observation of leakers: target that maybe survived the initial engagement for a subsequent engagement
        \\ solution: allocation of weapons and reservation of weapons to rengage any leakers
    \end{itemize}

    \item WTA is NP-Complete, so majority of solutions seek near-optimal solutions in real-time, or fast-enough solutions before the adversary reaches their goals.
    \item These solutions use heuristics or have exact solutions applied to variants of the WTA problem

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Formulations}

Notation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p_{i j}$ : the probability weaponi destroys target $j$
    \item $q_{i j} (= 1 - p_{i j})$ : the probability weapon $i$ fails to destroys target $j$
    \item $V_j$ : the destructive value of target $j$
    \item $x_{i j}$ : the number of weapons of type $i$ assigned to target $j$
    \item $K$ : the number of protected assets
    \item $a_k$ : the value of asset $k$
    \item $n$ : the number of targets
    \item $m$ : the number of weapon types
    \item $w_i$ : the number of weapons of type $i$
    \item $c_{i j}$ : a cost parameter for assigning a weapon of type $i$ to target $j$
    \item $\mathcal{F}$ : the set of feasible assignments
    \item $\gamma_{j k}$ : the probability target $j$ destroys asset $k$
    \item $s_j$ : the maximum number of weapons that can be assigned to target $j$
    \item $t$ : the number of stages
\end{itemize}


{\bf SWTA's main formulation}:
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\min & \sum_{j=1}^n V_j \prod_{i=1}^m q_{i j}^{x_{i j}} \\
\text { s.t. } & \sum_{j=1}^n x_{i j} \leq w_i \text {, for } i=1, \ldots, m \\
& x_{i j} \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}, \text {for } i=1, \ldots, m, j=1, \ldots, n
\end{array}
$$

In English: find the best assignment of number of weapons, across all types,
that minimizes the survival rate of the targets, with higher emphasis of those with more destructive value.
The ``such that (s.t.)'' requriements indicate that we must respect our supply capacity of weapons and 
that we must allocate at least weapon of each type to all targets.\\

Other formulations:
They make simplifying assumptions, such as assuming that the probability of using any weapon
to destroy a target is the same or that there is only a capacity of one weapon of each type. Maybe there is 
one weapon type per target. All of these different assumptions simplify optimization in some way, but obviously
each has its pros and cons in terms of optimizability and applicability to real-world scenarios.  

{\bf DWTA's main formulation}:
- I'm not going to really elaborate on the math; it gets substantially more complicated. I think an important 
takeaway is that because SWTA was already intractable with its large amount of permutations to begin with, 
DWTA is certainly intractable as well, given how it's basically just a stack of SWTAs. 
- Feel free to look at the math yourself, but be willing to spend a lot of attention and time. I just did not think it was worth it.
- Antoher important takeaway: it's a must to use approximation methods. 


\subsection*{Exact Algorithms for SWTA}

{\bf Maximum Marginal Return (MMR)}

This algorithm assums that the probabiilty of kill for any weapon target to target $j$ is the same.

Then, the optimal solution is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assign $x_{ij} = 1$ where $\{i, j\} \in argmax(V_j p_{ij})$
\item $V_j \leftarrow V_j(1-p_{ij})$
\item $p(i, \cdot) \leftarrow 0$ and $p(\cdot, j) \leftarrow 0$
\item Repeat until all weapons have been assigned
\end{enumerate}

Note that it's best to divide the weapons evenly across all targets when there is only one 
probability of kill, regardless of weapon or target.\\

\noindent {\bf On Solving the Original SWTA Formulation}

When you try exhaustive searches: a problem with $9$ weapons and $8$ targets
take $13$ min to run to completion, and adding one additional target takes $43.7$ min. to run to completion. 
Thus, there is a combinatorial explosion in run time as a function of the problem size.

\section*{Applying reinforcement learning to the weapon assignment problem in air defence \cite{rl_wa_airDefence_mouton_2011}}

\subsection*{Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monte Carlo control algorithm with Exploring Starts (MCES)
    \item Q-learning: an off-policy temporal-difference (TD) learning-control algorithm
    \item These algos. used in SIMPLIFIED version of weapon assignment (WA) problem
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item RL uses framework to define interaction between learning agent and environment in terms of states, actions, rewards
    \item RL agent must discover by trial and error to get highest reward 
    \item No exact method exists for the WA problem, evne when it is realtively small-sized 
    \item Compare to threat evaluation (TE), WA decisions are more quantifiable
    \item This article discusses whether RL is suitable for WA. 
    
    Flow: RL \& related work overview, greater context $\rightarrow$ command and control (C2), threat evaluation and weapon assignment (TEWA)
    $\rightarrow$ how WA problem was modeled and how MCES \& Q-learning were applied $\rightarrow$ compare experimental results 
    $\rightarrow$ ideas for future study
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Overview of reinforcement learning and related work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Azak \& Bayrak implemented agents for TWEA problems of C2 systems for decision-making.
    \item They sought to optimize decision-making performance for multi-armed-platform-TEWA problems 
    \item RL can be seen as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This allows agent designers to work with systems 
    in their current state, without worrying about how it came to be in that state in the first place. 
    \item RL loop: agent given info. about env. through sensory input $\rightarrow$ action $\rightarrow$ reward
    \item RL algos. maps each world state to agent actions
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Command and control}
\begin{itemize}
\item C2 system = facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, personnel essential for planning, directing, and controlling 
for a commander.
\item It involves observation, orientation, decision, and action. 
\item Observation: gather info. relevant to decision
\item Orientation: cognitive effort; breaking down problem into sub-problems and matching each with emergency plan $\rightarrow$ overall action plan 
\item Decision: whether to execute the action plan 
\item Action: execution of chosen course of action or plan, e.g. physical attack/movement, order issuance, sensor maintenance for better future observations
\item I don't think the rest of this subsection and the next one on threat evaluation and weapon assignment is that important for the lit. review.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Modeling the weapon assignment problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Asset to defend is at the center of the grid.
    \item 4 missile stations defended the asset. Once these stations were placed, they remained fixed.
    \item Threat takes straight line towards asset, and flies in from one of the cells. Once a threat reaches the asset, it eliminates the asset.
    \item Threat stays in specific cell while all the weapons get a turn to shoot at the threat. If all weapons miss, the threat moves one cell closer.
    \item If threat on weapon position, no shots can be fired. Thus, the threat gets a free pass to move one cell closer.
    \item

\section*{A Coordinated Air Defense Learning System Based on Immunized Classifier Systems \cite{immunized_nantogma_2021}}
    
    Multi-agent systems can be applied to defense and security applications, specifically to solve threat evaluation and weapon assignment problems. These applications require complex systems, due to both the complexity of the application domain and incompleteness and uncertainty of perceived information. In addition, many battlefield decisions are time sensitive. All of the above make it difficult to design an effective model. This paper combines an artificial immune system and a learning classifier system to tackle common threat evaluation and weapon assignment problems. 
    
    An artificial immune system is a multi-agent, decentralized information processing system that is capable of learning and remembering. It uses computational techniques derived from defense mechanisms native to biological immune systems to accomplish its goals. In an immune system, an antigen is a harmful foreign substance, like a bacterium. B-cells, or lymphocytes, are immune cells that produce antibodies: markers that mark an antigen to be eaten by a T-cell. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{CLONALG}, one such technique based on clonal selection, uses the idea of immunological memory to implement the learning and remembering component of the artificial immune system. Biological immune systems implement memory by cloning two types of B-cell. One type of B-cell immediately acts to combat infection, while the other type is retained by the immune system and grants immunity to future infection.
        
        \item \textbf{Danger theory} is another technique based on the fact that immune systems only respond to harmful foreign substances. Similarly, in an immunized air defense system, it's important to determine which threat to prioritize. When making a weapon target assignment, it's important to take the threat level of the targets into account. 

        Whenever a target, or hostile entity is detected, a danger zone is constructed, based on the trajectory of the detected target. The value of the combat units inside this danger zone signals how much priority should be given in intercepting the target.
        
        \item \textbf{Network theory}: In an immune system, the antibodies of many different B-cells, of the same and different type, are able to recognize and interact with each other, even without the presence of foreign substances. When one antibody recognizes the other, B-cells will produce different antibodies meant to suppress the recognized antibody, while the antibody that did the recognizing will get a boost in production. The resulting network of antibody interactions serves to broaden the diversity of the existing antibody population. 

    \end{itemize}   
    
    A learning classifier system is a decision making system that makes use of simple if-then rules, or classifiers. As it executes, the classifiers are slowly improved. In operation, it consists of three phases: performance, reinforcement, and discovery, in that order. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Performance:} In the performance phase, actions are selected and executed using an existing batch of classifiers. The classifiers that have that specific action are taken and stored in an action set. The executed action has an associated reward.
        
        \item \textbf{Reinforcement:} In the reinforcement phase, the parameters in the classifiers are updated using the reward from the performance phase. 
        
        The update equations for this phase for a classifier $cl$, are as follows: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Prediction $cl.p$: } 
                \begin{equation}
                    cl.p = cl.p + \beta(R-cl.p)
                \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Prediction Error $cl.\epsilon$: } 
                \begin{equation}
                    cl.\epsilon = cl.\epsilon + \beta(|R-cl.p| - cl.\epsilon)
                \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Fitness $cl.F$: } 
                \begin{equation}
                    cl.F = cl.F + \beta(\hat{\lambda}(cl) - cl.F)
                \end{equation}
            \item \textbf{Accuracy $\lambda(cl)$: }
                \begin{equation}
                    \lambda (cl) = 
                        \begin{cases}
                            1 & \text{if } cl.\epsilon < \epsilon_0 \\
                            \alpha(\frac{cl.\epsilon}{\epsilon_0})^{-v} & \text{if } cl.\epsilon \geq \epsilon_0
                        \end{cases}
                \end{equation}
               Where $\epsilon_0$ is an accuracy criterion constant. A classifier is accurate if $cl.\epsilon$ is smaller than $\epsilon_0$. $\alpha$ and $v$ are hyper-parameters used to control the rate at which the accuracy reduces. 
            \item \textbf{Relative accuracy $\hat{\lambda}(cl)$: }
                \begin{equation}
                    \hat{\lambda}(cl) = \frac{cl.n \times \lambda(cl)}{\sigma_{cl_b \in [A]} \lambda(b) \times b.n}
                \end{equation}
        \end{itemize}

        \item \textbf{Discovery:} In the discovery phase, the algorithm applies a genetic algorithm to generate a new batch of classifiers. Two parents with high fitness are selected from the action set, and offspring are produced using a crossover algorithm and a random bit-flip mutation. Classifiers with low fitness are deleted if the number of total classifiers in the batch get too large, and classifiers whose conditionals are already included in more accurate, experienced classifiers can be deleted.
    \end{itemize} 
     
    In a generic air defense mission, the two problems to solve are action strategy selection and cooperation. Thus, we use two agents, one in charge of generating strategies, and one in charge of coordinating defenses. The strategy generation agent uses a learning classifier system to learn the right weapon and amount of ammunition to use against given targets. These classifiers are passed to the strategy coordination agent. Then, the strategy coordination agent uses immune network dynamics to decide what to do, given the classifiers that the strategy generation agent created. 

    The strategy generation agent treats each weapon type as a B-cell, or decision unit, that each have their own classifiers, or antibodies. Each classifier will have control decisions as their consequent (the THEN component of the IF-THEN statement). Enemy forces are expressed in terms of their intent, capability, and opportunity. When individual B-cells activate on detection of antigens, or hostile units, the strategy generation agent generates a set of classifiers, from which the strategy generation agent selects the most appropriate action. The strategy generation agent interfaces with the environment through an intermediate module, which also provides local detectors for the B-cells.

    The strategy coordination agent receives classifiers from the strategy generation agent, establishes connections between the classifiers, forming a network. Then, it applies immune network dynamics. Classifier $i$ is said to be connected to classifier $j$ if they produce antibodies for the same target. The concentrations for each classifier is calculated, and the one with the highest concentration ultimately is chosen as the action. The output classifiers from this immune network dynamics process are the ones that undergo genetic operations and updates. 
    
    \textbf{Specific Equations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Objective Function:} 
        At time $T$, for targets detected $H$ and $C$ categories of weapons for each agent, with each category $C_p$ having $j$ ammunition, the objective function is
            \begin{equation}
                O_{b} = 
                \begin{cases}
                    min & \sum^{H'(t)}_{j=1} \sum^{C}_{i=1}\beta_i q_{ij} \delta_{ij} \\
                    max & \sum^{H'(t)}_{j=1} v_j (1 - \prod^{C}_{i=1} (1-p_{ij})^{\delta_{ij}(s)})
                \end{cases}
            \end{equation}
             Where $H'$ is the remaining number of unassigned detected targets/enemy units, $\delta_{ij}$ is the minimum delay before weapon $i$ can be deployed against target $j$ based on
ready time and current allocation of that weapon, $q_{ij}$ is the quantity of ammunition of weapon of type $i$ allocated to target $j$, $b_i$ is the unit cost of the ammunition of weapon $i$, $v_j$ is the threat value of target $j$, and $p_{ij}$ is the weapon kill probability.
        \item \textbf{Expected Action Payoff $P(a_i)$: } 
            Given a set of classifiers matching the attributes of a specific B-cell $[M]$, the expected action payoff for a specific action $a_i$ is
            \begin{equation}
                P(a_i) = \frac{\sum_{cl_{k} \in [M] | a_i} cl_{k}.p \times cl_k.F * \omega}{\sum_{cl_{k} \in [M] | a_i} cl_l.F * \omega}
            \end{equation}
            Where $\omega$ is the affinity between the B-cells' classifiers and antigens. This is the reward that the agent receives for performing a specific action. 
            
        \item \textbf{Classifier-Antigen Affinity $\omega$: }
            \begin{equation}
                \omega = [1 - \prod^{q}_{i=1}(1-d_g * p_g * w_e * r_t)] * v_c
            \end{equation}
            Where $q$ is the quantity of ammo suggested by the classifier, $d_g$ is the normalized distance between target $c$ and the friendly unit (B-cell), $p_g$ is the speed advantage of firing the weapon against the target, $w_e$ is the kill probability of the weapon suggested, $r_t$ is the ready time of the weapon if it were to be deployed, and $v_c$ is an estimate for the value of the target. 

            This value tells you how good a weapon (described in a classifier) is, against a specific antigen. 

        \item \textbf{Classifier Concentration $a_i(t+1)$: }
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{da_i(t+1)}{dt} = \left(
                    \alpha \sum^{N}_{j=1}m_{ji}a_j(t) - \beta\sum^{N}_{j=1}m_{ik}a_k(t) + \gamma m_i - k
                    \right) a_i(t)
            \end{equation}
            Where $N$ is the number of classifiers that deal with the target antigen, $m_i$ is the affinity between classifier $i$ and the target antigen, $m_{ji}$ is the mutual stimulus coefficient of antibody $j$ on classifier $i$, $m_{ki}$ is the inhibitory effect of classifier $k$ on classifier $i$, $k$ is the natural death rate of classifier $i$, $a_i(t)$, $a_j(t)$, and $a_k(t)$ are the bounded concentrations that are imposed on the classifiers, and coefficients $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are weight factors that determine the significance of each term. 
            
            This ordinary differential equation embodies the immune network dynamics that this algorithm leverages. Classifiers compete with each other via this concentration value. Since it is an ordinary differential equation, you have to calculate the next step's value using previous values, like any other algorithmic differential equation solver.
