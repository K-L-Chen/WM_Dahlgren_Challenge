Kill probabilities are not additive; the odds that multiple weapons kill a target is greater than the sum of the odds that each one kills the target summed up, since you can do things such as attack from various angles. This allows us to constrain the algorithm further to improve performance. Furthermore, user-imposed constraints (such as restrictions on the number of weapons that can be assigned to a given target) can massively improve performance. Since different algorithms are better at different levels of searching (genetic algorithms are good at global searching but get stuck in local optima easily, harmony search is very good at local optimization), switching from one to another at various points in the calculation can also dramatically improve performance.
