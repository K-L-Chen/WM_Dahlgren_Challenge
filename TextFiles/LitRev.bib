abstract = {Research addressing the Weapon Target Assignment (WTA) Problem, the problem of assigning weapons to targets while considering their effective probability of kill, began with Manne’s seminal work in 1958. In the years following, improved modeling and solution techniques have been developed, along with improvements in computing power, which have enabled researchers to consider more complex variants of the problem, to include models with fewer assumptions and models in which time is a parameter. Herein, we review the various model formulations, exact algorithms, and heuristic algorithms for the static and dynamic WTA. We place the formulations into a comparable form and use this form to provide insight into the evolution of the defense-related WTA problem. The solution methods are comparatively analyzed and an analysis of the influence of past work is conducted. More recent developments are introduced and discussed.}

abstract = {The target's threat prediction is an essential procedure for the situation analysis in an aerial defense system. However, the traditional threat prediction methods mostly ignore the effect of commander's emotion. They only predict a target's present threat from the target's features itself, which leads to their poor ability in a complex situation. To aerial targets, this paper proposes a method for its potential threat prediction considering commander emotion (PTP-CE) that uses the Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) network and the backpropagation neural network (BP) optimized by the sparrow search algorithm (SSA). Furthermore, we use the BiLSTM to predict the target's future state from real-time series data, and then adopt the SSA-BP to combine the target's state with the commander's emotion to establish a threat prediction model. Therefore, the target's potential threat level can be obtained by this threat prediction model from the predicted future state and the recognized emotion. The experimental results show that the PTP-CE is efficient for aerial target's state prediction and threat prediction, regardless of commander's emotional effect.}
