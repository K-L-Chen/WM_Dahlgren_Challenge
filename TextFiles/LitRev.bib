  abstract = {Research addressing the Weapon Target Assignment (WTA) Problem, the problem of assigning weapons to targets while considering their effective probability of kill, began with Manneâ€™s seminal work in 1958. In the years following, improved modeling and solution techniques have been developed, along with improvements in computing power, which have enabled researchers to consider more complex variants of the problem, to include models with fewer assumptions and models in which time is a parameter. Herein, we review the various model formulations, exact algorithms, and heuristic algorithms for the static and dynamic WTA. We place the formulations into a comparable form and use this form to provide insight into the evolution of the defense-related WTA problem. The solution methods are comparatively analyzed and an analysis of the influence of past work is conducted. More recent developments are introduced and discussed.}

  abstract = {The modern battlefield is a fast-paced, information-rich environment, where discovery of intent, situation awareness and the rapid evolution of concepts of operation and doctrine are critical success factors. A combination of the techniques investigated and tested in this work, together with other techniques in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and modern computational techniques, may hold the key to relieving the burden of the decision-maker and aiding in better decision-making under pressure. The techniques investigated in this article were two methods from the machine-learning subfield of reinforcement learning (RL), namely a Monte Carlo (MC) control algorithm with exploring starts (MCES), and an off-policy temporal-difference (TD) learning-control algorithm, Q-learning. These techniques were applied to a simplified version of the weapon assignment (WA) problem in air defence. The MCES control algorithm yielded promising results when searching for an optimal shooting order. A greedy approach was taken in the Q-learning algorithm, but experimentation showed that the MCES-control algorithm still performed significantly better than the Q-learning algorithm, even though it was slower.}
