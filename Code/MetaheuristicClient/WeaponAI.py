"""
The Weapon_AI class handles decision-making for a specific type of weapon. For example, since we have Chainshot
and Cannonball as the two types of weapon systems at our disposal, we would have a Weapon_AI object in charge of
Chainshot logic, and another in charge of Cannonball logic.

This class is analogous to the B-cell from the immunized classifier paper.
